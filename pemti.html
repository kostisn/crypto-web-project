    <head2>The Relationship Between Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</head2>
<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency are terms you will often hear used together. While they are two distinctly different technologies, they are also inherently intertwined with one another.</p>

<p>Essentially a digitalized, decentralized, public ledger, blockchain is a formation of digital information, or blocks, stored across a network of computers creating a database. When verifiable transactions take place, the information is stored in blocks, which, when full, are added to the chain. Cryptocurrency operates through the blockchain, as it too is a decentralized, digital system. Defined as a digital or virtual currency, crypto uses cryptography for security and is not owned by any particular authority, making it difficult for governments to manipulate.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but the list has subsequently mushroomed to more than 10,000. Blockchain technology was, in fact, popularized as the foundation for Bitcoin. Despite many doubts and a lot of skepticism, both technologies have become an important part of our economic systems for the foreseeable future. Much has changed and advanced in recent years, but with the terms so closely aligned, a great deal of confusion still exists.</p>

<head3>How blockchain and cryptocurrency work together</head3>
<p>Rather than being an optional technology for cryptocurrency, blockchain is a foundational feature of it. Ultimately, the growth and development of blockchain has been fuelled by cryptocurrencies, as crypto relies on its network to exist. But blockchain transcends cryptocurrency applications. Not restricted to the financial sector, the technology offers multiple solutions that have already, and will continue to, disrupt diverse markets in the years to come.</p>

<p>The terms have become synonymous, perhaps because the first blockchain was the database on which every bitcoin (the first cryptocurrency) transaction was stored. When blockchain was first implemented in 2009, it was not known as such. It assumed its name because of the way the transactions were grouped into blocks of data, then chained together by way of a mathematical function that creates a hash code. The concept of a cryptographically secured chain of information blocks had originally been envisaged in 1982, then developed in the early 1990s, but it was this revolutionary original cryptocurrency that brought the system to prominence.</p>
