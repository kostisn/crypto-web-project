<title> Who Am I</title>
<head1>Who Am I </head1> 
<p>I am Ioannis patramanis an undergraduate student of the Computers Science programme In Athens Tech
I have been always curious about computers and electronic devices and from a small age i was experiementing with them,
however after graduating high school i decided to study Accoutning and Finance , after a litle time though i knew that this was not the subject i wanted to deticate the rest of my life to,
thats why i dropped out and decided to persue my dreams and become a computer scientist.</p>
In my early years i used to play water polo[1] for almost a decade but i was forced to stop during a serius injury on my back,still to this day though
there is nothing i like more than exercedsing, thats why in my free time i go to the gym and sometimes i even box [2].
I have never been a huge fans of reading books , beeing dyslexic as i am makes it kind of difficult , but i always enjoy a good philoshofocal book .
